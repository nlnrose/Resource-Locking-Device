9/5 - Topic: Introduction
  
    We introduced ourselves and started to consider the best ways to communicate and develop a plan of action.
    
    Outcome: 
    -Jesse set up a slack channel for communication.
    -Hunter will document team progress.
    -Each team member was to read over the project recquirements and return on thursday with questions.
    
9/7 - Topic: Further discussion of solution approach

    Team members met today to review Device.java code that Hunter wrote. More discussion on current blocks to team progress.
    Block included: Little experience with team development projects; Lacking direction and structure; Some self-conciousness
    around bringing personal work and integrating it with others.
    
    Outcome: 
    -After some collaboration, we became clear on the requirements and what we needed to produce. Hunter presented his
     implementation of Device.Java as the group performed a code review.  We discussed how me could partion the project up
     into possible pairs of code and test. We spent somet time becoming familiar with GitHub and how the works for collaborating.
    -Nolan will write tests to test our Device class.
    -We made a plan that over the next few days, we will individually consider implementations for the unlocker.
    
    -Next meeting will cover the Design / Architecture phase of the project.
